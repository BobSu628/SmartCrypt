 DESCRIPTION:                                                                                                                                           
 * Uses object-oriented programming style.
 * Able to perform 3 types of encryption and decryption. 
 * Allows the user to choose between 3 encryption/decryption methods(ROT n,    
Vigenere, XOR), takes the plaintext/ciphertext and the key as user input,   
and displays the encrypted/decrypted text.

 ERROR HANDLING:                                                                                                                                         
 * This program has its own custom exception type: Text Invalid Exception.     
 * This program has error check for every user input to ensure that all inputs are valid.
