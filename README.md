 *******************************************************************************
 DESCRIPTION:                                                                                                                                           
 * This program uses object-oriented programming style, efficiently performs   
 * 3 types of encryption and decryption covered in the TEJ3M1 curriculum. It   
 * allows the user to choose between 3 encryption/decryption methods(ROT n,    
 * Vigenere, XOR), takes the plaintext/ciphertext and the key as user input,   
 * and displays the encrypted/decrypted text.

 ERROR HANDLING:                                                                                                                                         
 * This program has its own custom exception type: Text Invalid Exception.     
 * This program has error check for every user input to ensure that all inputs 
 * are valid.
